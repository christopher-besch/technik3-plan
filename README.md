Edit the following files:

groups.csv - one group per line; first column: name

stations.csv - one station per line; fist column: name, second: amount of slots necessary to teach a set of groups, third column: amount of groups per set

Execute main.py (with Python 3) or main.exe and input the amount of calculations wanted (10 000 is a good starting value) and the amount of slots available at the day

plan.csv - result: first section is sorted by station, the lower one by groups
